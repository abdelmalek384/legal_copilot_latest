# Legal Copilot — release-candidate status

**Updated:** 2026-11-14  
**Decision:** **NOT READY** for lawyer pilot or production. This is an engineering checkpoint, not legal, security or operational certification. Historical tracker detail is archived at [STATUS history](archive/STATUS_history_through_2026-11-13.md).

## AI-1 delivery

| Workstream | Current state |
|---|---|
| Answer rating contract | **Complete.** [Contract](answer_rating_contract.md) defines answer ID, rating, cited-article rating, notes, rater, timestamp, trust tier and UTF-8 CSV export for AI-2. `tools/validate_answer_ratings.py` validates exported CSV structure, enums and timezone-aware timestamps; tests are committed but unexecuted. |
| Negation guard | **Implemented; tests unexecuted.** Always-on guard is in `app.ask()`. Three focused English/Arabic reproductions and an integrated answer-path test are committed directly to main (`92e5177`, `f988e76`). No test pass is claimed. |
| Firm-test source-matched mode | **Fail-closed response gate implemented; real retrieval unavailable.** Exact firm-ID + non-production environment flag, source-only fallback and explicit `source-matched, not lawyer-verified` API label are on main (`ce2ebc8`, `7c5e09d`, `5ec22a1`, `b377af0`, `311287d`, `2009b9f`, `29e4a13`). The dedicated scope currently returns no candidates; tests use synthetic hits and are unexecuted. Never enable in production. |
| Reviewer spreadsheets | **Templates complete.** [Gazette review CSV](legal_evidence/law_14_2025_gazette_comparison_template.csv) has 311 rows, machine comparison labels, similarity, page locators and prior page-review notes. Text and lawyer decision fields remain blank pending authorized source text. [Deadline CSV](legal_evidence/deadline_rules_lawyer_review.csv) has five draft rules. [Review guide](legal_evidence/lawyer_review_quick_guide.md) gives steps and time estimates. |
| Evaluation | **116 unapproved drafts complete; metrics unavailable.** Dataset contains 58 formal + 58 colloquial questions with machine-proposed article IDs. [Unreviewed inventory](legal_evidence/law14_2025_retrieval_baseline_unreviewed.json) records 116 unique questions, zero approved answer keys and zero run records. Top-3 hit rate, wrong-article rate and abstention rate are null—not zero. The scorer requires lawyer-approved labels and real retrieval runs. |
| Documentation | **Complete.** Detailed tracker archived; this is the concise release summary. |

## Legal evidence boundary

- Labour Law 14/2025 remains **source-matched, not lawyer-reviewed**; `verified=0` for all 311 candidate rows; `authoritative=false` and `retrieval_eligible=false`.
- The supplied ZIP candidate was structurally inventoried: 13 promulgation provisions + 298 articles, no missing/duplicate article numbers, malformed rows 0. See [inventory audit](legal_evidence/law14_2025_uploaded_candidate_inventory_audit.json). This was not an importer run.
- Collection/reuse permission remains unknown and the supplied scan reports copy/print restrictions. Do not commit or serve the candidate text, or bypass source restrictions.
- Decisions 248–252/2026 are metadata-only related-instrument candidates; full text is restricted/unavailable, permission unknown and legal review pending.
- No law becomes verified without qualified Egyptian counsel reviewing text, commencement, amendments/currentness and source rights.

## Remaining gates

1. GitHub billing/runtime access or a supported local Python 3.12 environment is needed to execute the focused tests; no CI or local test output is claimed.
2. AI-2 must integrate the rating contract with its UI/export.
3. Owner must supply an authorized plain-text Gazette transcription and evidence of permitted reuse before the importer can run.
4. Counsel must approve the evaluation questions/article key and answerability; then an authenticated corpus/API and before/after run exports are needed for scoring.
5. Billing/provider acceptance, tenant-isolation/recovery rehearsal, device/accessibility acceptance and pilot-firm workflow remain separate release gates.

**Last formally recalculated whole-project score:** 50.10% (2026-11-01). No newer weighted score is asserted.
